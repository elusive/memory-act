# Issues

### Things I've seen
~1. Need tile numbering to be dynamic and 1/2.min() repeated.~

2. Manage state in single direction, down from game instance
    - matches array - game level
    - tiles clicked count
    - state of each tile in collection
    - matched can be maintained in each card (for appearance)

3. Timer start and handling for 2 tiles clicked.
