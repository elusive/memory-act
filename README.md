# Memory Act

This is a simple card-based memory game. The original game is [here](https://pwa-memory-game.surge.sh/) and is written using VanillaJS.

I wanted to try rewriting it using React Hooks and React Context. This Memory Act game is the result. The style is the same but the code was a
complete rewrite. My first refactor/rewrite was using class components, no hooks, and no state management. The final version uses functional components, hooks, and react context api for state management.

### Getting Started

In order to play the game you can clone the repository and execute the `yarn install' command.

Then 'yarn start' runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Updates

The change log contains updates as they are made to the application.
