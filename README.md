# Memory Act

This is a simple card-based memory game. The original game is [here](https://pwa-memory-game.surge.sh/) and is written using VanillaJS.

I wanted to try rewriting it using React and ES6 classes. This Memory Act game is the result. The style is the same but the code was a
complete rewrite.

### Getting Started

In order to play the game you can clone the repository and execute the `yarn install' command.

Then 'yarn start' runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
